## What I do

Analyze your entire codebase and create 7 comprehensive documentation files in `.planning/codebase/`:

- **STACK.md** - Technologies, dependencies, configuration
- **INTEGRATIONS.md** - 3rd party providers, APIs, databases, auth providers
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System patterns, layers, data flow
- **STRUCTURE.md** - Directory layout, key locations, naming conventions
- **CONVENTIONS.md** - Code style, patterns, error handling
- **TESTING.md** - Framework, structure, mocking, coverage
- **CONCERNS.md** - Tech debt, bugs, security, performance issues

## When to use me

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Onboard** new developers to understand the codebase quickly
- **Plan** new features with full context of existing patterns
- **Understand** code conventions before making changes
- **Identify** technical debt and areas of concern
- **Document** the current state of the project

## How it works

This skill orchestrates 4 parallel agents, each exploring a specific focus area:

1. **Tech Agent** → Analyzes stack and integrations → STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
2. **Architecture Agent** → Analyzes patterns and structure → ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
3. **Quality Agent** → Analyzes conventions and testing → CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
4. **Concerns Agent** → Identifies tech debt and issues → CONCERNS.md

Each agent:
- Explores the codebase in a fresh context
- Uses templates from `$SKILL_PATH/templates/`
- Writes documents directly to `.planning/codebase/`
- Returns only confirmation (not document contents)

The orchestrator:
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` directory
- Spawns 4 parallel agents with `run_in_background=true`
- Collects confirmations
- Verifies all documents created
- Commits the codebase map (if configured)

## Process

### Step 1: Check Existing Map

If `.planning/codebase/` already exists, prompt:
```
.planning/codebase/ already exists. What's next?
1. Refresh - Delete existing and remap codebase
2. Update - Keep existing, only update specific documents
3. Skip - Use existing codebase map as-is
```

### Step 2: Create Structure

Create the output directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/codebase
```

### Step 3: Spawn Parallel Agents

Use the `Task` tool with `agent_type="explore"` and `run_in_background=true` for parallel execution.

**Tech Agent:**
```
agent_type: explore
description: Map codebase tech stack
prompt: |
	Focus: tech

	Analyze this codebase for technology stack and external integrations.

	Write these documents to .planning/codebase/:
	- STACK.md - Languages, runtime, frameworks, dependencies, configuration
	- INTEGRATIONS.md - External APIs, databases, auth providers, webhooks

	Use the templates from map-codebase skill. Explore thoroughly.
	Write documents directly. Return confirmation only.
```

**Architecture Agent:**
```
agent_type: explore
description: Map codebase architecture
prompt: |
	Focus: arch

	Analyze this codebase architecture and directory structure.

	Write these documents to .planning/codebase/:
	- ARCHITECTURE.md - Pattern, layers, data flow, abstractions, entry points
	- STRUCTURE.md - Directory layout, key locations, naming conventions

	Use the templates from map-codebase skill. Explore thoroughly.
	Write documents directly. Return confirmation only.
```

**Quality Agent:**
```
agent_type: explore
description: Map codebase conventions
prompt: |
	Focus: quality

	Analyze this codebase for coding conventions and testing patterns.

	Write these documents to .planning/codebase/:
	- CONVENTIONS.md - Code style, naming, patterns, error handling
	- TESTING.md - Framework, structure, mocking, coverage

	Use the templates from map-codebase skill. Explore thoroughly.
	Write documents directly. Return confirmation only.
```

**Concerns Agent:**
```
agent_type: explore
description: Map codebase concerns
prompt: |
	Focus: concerns

	Analyze this codebase for technical debt, known issues, and areas of concern.

	Write this document to .planning/codebase/:
	- CONCERNS.md - Tech debt, bugs, security, performance, fragile areas

	Use the templates from map-codebase skill. Explore thoroughly.
	Write document directly. Return confirmation only.
```

### Step 4: Verify Output

Check that all documents were created:
```bash
ls -la .planning/codebase/
wc -l .planning/codebase/*.md
```

### Step 5: Commit (Optional)

If `.planning/` is not gitignored and the user wants to commit:
```bash
git add .planning/codebase/*.md
git commit -m "docs: map existing codebase

- STACK.md - Technologies and dependencies
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System design and patterns
- STRUCTURE.md - Directory layout
- CONVENTIONS.md - Code style and patterns
- TESTING.md - Test structure
- INTEGRATIONS.md - External services
- CONCERNS.md - Technical debt and issues"
```

### Step 6: Summary

Present completion summary:
```
Codebase mapping complete.

Created .planning/codebase/:
- STACK.md ([N] lines) - Technologies and dependencies
- ARCHITECTURE.md ([N] lines) - System design and patterns
- STRUCTURE.md ([N] lines) - Directory layout and organization
- CONVENTIONS.md ([N] lines) - Code style and patterns
- TESTING.md ([N] lines) - Test structure and practices
- INTEGRATIONS.md ([N] lines) - External services and APIs
- CONCERNS.md ([N] lines) - Technical debt and issues

Next steps:
- Review documents: cat .planning/codebase/STACK.md
- Use these as reference when planning features
- Update as codebase evolves
```

## Templates

Templates are located in `$SKILL_PATH/templates/`:

- `STACK.md.template` - Technology stack
- `INTEGRATIONS.md.template` - External integrations
- `ARCHITECTURE.md.template` - System architecture
- `STRUCTURE.md.template` - Directory structure
- `CONVENTIONS.md.template` - Coding conventions
- `TESTING.md.template` - Testing patterns
- `CONCERNS.md.template` - Technical concerns

Each agent reads the appropriate template and fills it in based on codebase exploration.

## Agent Guidelines

When spawned as a mapper agent:

### Exploration Commands

**Helper: Use fd if available, fall back to find**
```bash
# Define finder helper (fd if available, otherwise find)
_finder() { command -v fd >/dev/null 2>&1 && fd "$@" || find "$@"; }
_rg() { command -v rg >/dev/null 2>&1 && rg "$@" || grep -r "$@"; }
```

**Tech Focus:**
```bash
# Package manifests
cat package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod 2>/dev/null

# Config files
ls -la *.config.* .env* tsconfig.json 2>/dev/null

# Find SDK/API imports
_rg "import.*stripe|import.*supabase|import.*aws" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**Architecture Focus:**
```bash
# Directory structure (fd is faster and ignores node_modules/.git by default)
_finder -t d . | head -50

# Entry points
_finder -t f "index.*" "main.*" "app.*" src/ app/ 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Import patterns
_rg "^import" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -100
```

**Quality Focus:**
```bash
# Linting/formatting config
cat .eslintrc* .prettierrc* biome.json 2>/dev/null

# Test files
_finder -t f "\.test\." "\.spec\." 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

**Concerns Focus:**
```bash
# TODO/FIXME comments
_rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -50

# Large files (potential complexity)
_finder -t f "\.ts$" -e "\.tsx$" src/ 2>/dev/null | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -20
```

### Critical Rules

1. **Write documents directly** - Use the Write tool, don't return contents
2. **Always include file paths** - Every finding needs a file path in backticks
3. **Use the templates** - Fill in the template structure exactly
4. **Be thorough** - Read actual files, don't guess
5. **Return only confirmation** - Response should be ~10 lines with file paths and line counts
6. **Don't commit** - The orchestrator handles git operations

## Benefits

- **Fast**: Parallel exploration reduces total time
- **Fresh context**: Each agent starts clean, no token contamination
- **Minimal context transfer**: Agents write directly, orchestrator only receives confirmations
- **Comprehensive**: 7 structured documents cover all aspects of the codebase
- **Reusable**: Documents serve as reference for future planning and development
