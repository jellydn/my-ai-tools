## Token Efficiency

- Keep responses concise and actionable; lead with conclusions, file paths, and verification.
- Read only task-relevant files and instructions. Do not preload repository maps, architecture docs, memory, or skills.
- Scope searches and command output with paths, filters, and line ranges.
- Use `~/.local/bin/rtk` for supported shell commands when available; bypass it with `RTK_DISABLED=1` when raw output is required.
- Prefer `codebase-memory-mcp` graph tools for structural code discovery when available.
