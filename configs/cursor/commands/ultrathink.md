description: Deep thinking mode for complex problem solving with extended reasoning
---

Engage deep thinking mode for complex analysis and problem-solving.

Take your time to:
1. Break down the problem into smaller components
2. Analyze each component thoroughly
3. Consider multiple approaches and their trade-offs
4. Think through edge cases and potential issues
5. Synthesize a comprehensive solution

Provide detailed reasoning for your conclusions and recommendations.

## Process

### 1. Problem Analysis
- What is the core problem?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the requirements?
- What are the success criteria?

### 2. Information Gathering
- What information do I have?
- What information do I need?
- What assumptions am I making?
- Are my assumptions valid?

### 3. Solution Exploration
- What are the possible approaches?
- What are the pros and cons of each?
- What are the risks?
- What are the dependencies?

### 4. Deep Dive
- What are the technical challenges?
- What are the edge cases?
- What could go wrong?
- How can we mitigate risks?

### 5. Synthesis
- What is the best approach and why?
- What is the implementation plan?
- What are the next steps?
- What should we monitor?

## Output

Provide a comprehensive analysis with:
- Clear explanation of the problem
- Detailed reasoning for your approach
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Expected outcomes and metrics for success
