# OpenCode Global Guidelines

## Communication

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Read a relevant `CONTEXT.md` when it governs terms or behavior you change.

## Token Efficiency

- Keep responses concise and actionable; lead with conclusions, file paths, and verification.
- Read only task-relevant files and instructions. Do not preload repository maps, architecture docs, memory, or skills.
- Scope searches and command output with paths, filters, and line ranges.
- Use `~/.local/bin/rtk` for supported shell commands when available; bypass it with `RTK_DISABLED=1` when raw output is required.
- Prefer `codebase-memory-mcp` graph tools for structural code discovery when available.

## General Practices

- Read `~/.ai-tools/best-practices.md` only when the repository lacks equivalent guidance or the task needs its detailed workflow.
- Read `~/.ai-tools/MEMORY.md` and `~/.ai-tools/agent-memory.md` only when deciding whether or where to persist a learning.
- Read `~/.ai-tools/git-guidelines.md` before destructive or history-changing git operations.
- Ask before destructive operations. Prefer clear, simple, self-documenting code.
- Run the repository's focused tests, typecheck, and lint checks after changes.
