# OpenCode Global Guidelines

## Communication

Always talk in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Always read CONTEXT.md files if present, and use their ubiquitous language.

## Token Efficiency

- Keep responses concise and actionable; lead with conclusions, file paths, and verification.
- Scope searches and file reads to the task. Limit command output with filters and line ranges.
- Use `~/.local/bin/rtk` for supported shell commands when available; bypass it with `RTK_DISABLED=1` when raw output is required.
- Prefer `codebase-memory-mcp` graph tools for structural code discovery when available.
- Load supplemental guidance only when the task requires it. Start a fresh session when switching to unrelated work.

## General Practices

- Read `~/.ai-tools/best-practices.md` only when the repository lacks equivalent guidance or the task needs its detailed workflow.
- Read `~/.ai-tools/MEMORY.md` and `~/.ai-tools/agent-memory.md` only when deciding whether or where to persist a learning.
- Read `~/.ai-tools/git-guidelines.md` before destructive or history-changing git operations.
- Ask before destructive operations. Prefer clear, simple, self-documenting code.
- Run the repository's focused tests, typecheck, and lint checks after changes.
