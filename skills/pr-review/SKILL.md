# Fix PR Review Comments

Fix PR review comments by implementing the requested changes.

## Usage

```bash
/pr-review <PR_URL>      # Review PR by URL (expects full GitHub URL)
/pr-review <PR_NUMBER>   # Review PR by number (expects number, e.g., 123)
/pr-review               # Auto-detect PR from current branch
```

### 📋 Argument Handling

The command accepts the PR identifier from `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **PR URL**: Full GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`)
2. **PR Number**: Just the PR number (e.g., `123`)
3. **No Arguments**: Auto-detect the PR associated with the current Git branch

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the PR identifier. Otherwise, auto-detect the current branch's PR using:
```bash
gh pr view --json number,url -q '.number'
```
This extracts the PR number from the current branch's open PR for use in subsequent commands.

If no open PR is found for the current branch, show this error:
```text
Error: No open pull request found for the current branch.

To review a specific PR:
  /pr-review <PR_URL>
  /pr-review <PR_NUMBER>

Or create a PR first:
  gh pr create
```

## Process

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine PR identifier (URL, number, or auto-detect)
2. Fetch PR details and review comments using `gh` CLI
3. Parse review comments to understand what needs to be changed
4. For each comment, implement the fix
5. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
6. Commit the changes

## Available Scripts

### Extract PR Comments

The `extract-pr-comments.js` script processes GitHub PR review comments and issue comments to create actionable TODO lists.

```bash
# Usage
node $SKILL_PATH/scripts/extract-pr-comments.js <review-comments-file> <issue-comments-file> [output-file]

# Example
node $SKILL_PATH/scripts/extract-pr-comments.js \
  pr-4972-review-comments-raw.json \
  pr-4972-issue-comments-raw.json \
  pr-4972-comments.ndjson
```

**What it does:**
- Filters out comments with replies (likely resolved)
- Classifies comments by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Categorizes comments (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Creates 3 output files:
  - `.ndjson` - Structured comment data
  - `-todo.md` - Prioritized TODO list
  - `-summary.md` - Analysis summary with emojis

**Severity classification:**
- 🔴 **Critical**: security, vulnerability, exploit
- 🟠 **High**: bug, error, breaking, crash, fail
- 🟡 **Medium**: performance, improvement, refactor, optimize
- 🟢 **Low**: everything else

**Categories:**
- 🔒 Security
- ⚡ Performance
- 🔧 Maintainability
- ♿ Accessibility
- 🧪 Testing
- 📚 Documentation
- 🏷️ Typing
- 🎨 Style
- ✨ Code Quality

## Examples

```bash
# Fix review comments for a PR using URL
/pr-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Fix review comments using PR number
/pr-review 123

# Auto-detect PR from current branch
/pr-review

# After extracting comments with the script, work through the TODO list
# The TODO list is ordered by priority: Critical → High → Medium → Low
```
